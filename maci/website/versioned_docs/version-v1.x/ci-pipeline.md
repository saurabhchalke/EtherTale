# Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline is an automated workflow to ensure that software is always in a working state. An event like opening a pull request causes a pipeline to run. The pipeline consists of an automated build process and a suite of automated tests (See [Testing](https://pse.dev/docs/testing) for more details).

## Pipeline Triggers

### Commit to Main Branch

Each commit (i.e. a merged PR) to the main branch triggers the pipeline. The pipeline creates packages that can be deployed to any environment. Packages are uploaded to an artifact repository (e.g. npm).

### Pull Request (PR)

When a pull request has been created (or updated), it triggers the PR pipeline. It gives the reviewer confidence that the software works as expected with the introduced code changes.

### Nightly

Nightly build runs every midnight. It is to ensure that all required dependencies are present and to show no bugs have been introduced.

### Tag Push

When a tag has been pushed, it triggers a release pipeline. It will draft a release note with an auto-generated changelog and publish npm package(s).
