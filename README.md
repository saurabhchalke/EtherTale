# EtherTale: Weave Stories Together, Forever 🌿📖🔗

EtherTale is an innovative, decentralized storytelling platform that combines the power of AI-generated narratives with the security and transparency of the Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) voting system. With EtherTale, users can collaboratively create immersive, branching storylines by voting on the direction of the tale at each decision point.

This project was built as part of [ETHTaipei 2024](https://ethtaipei.org/).

## Features ✨

- 🤖 AI-generated story content using advanced language models
- 🔒 Secure and transparent voting with the MACI protocol
- 🌿 Immersive, branching narratives that evolve based on community choices
- 🎨 Sleek, cyberpunk-inspired user interface
- ⚡️ Real-time updates and seamless user experience

## How It Works 🛠️

1. 🚀 Users join an EtherTale story and are presented with an AI-generated story snippet.
2. 🤔 At key decision points, users vote on the direction they want the story to take using the MACI protocol.
3. 🗳️ Votes are securely tallied, ensuring privacy and preventing collusion.
4. 🔮 The winning choice is revealed, and the AI continues the story based on the community's decision.
5. 🔄 The process repeats, with users shaping the story at each junction until the tale reaches its conclusion.
